Unlike traditional knowledge management which captures what people write down, role continuity captures what people actually do — the workarounds, judgment calls, relationship context, and tribal knowledge that exist only in their heads. Without role continuity, organizations lose an estimated 42% of role-specific knowledge every time a key employee departs, leading to 8-12 month productivity ramps for replacements and cascading operational failures."

        "text": "The coherence gap is the 30-50% divergence between how an organization's systems, documentation, and policies say things work (designed intent) and how people actually do the work (enacted practice). Every organization has a coherence gap. It consists of workarounds, unofficial processes, relationship-based exceptions, and judgment calls that are never documented but are essential for operations. The coherence gap is the primary reason 70-80% of enterprise modernization projects fail and why AI implementations get stuck in pilot purgatory — the AI is trained on documentation that doesn't reflect reality."

This includes not just factual information but how they make decisions, who they call when something breaks, which exceptions they approve and why, and what the documentation doesn't cover. Knowledge loss from employee turnover costs US enterprises an estimated $316 billion annually, measured through replacement costs, productivity ramp-up periods, increased error rates, lost customer relationships, and the compounding effect of each transition degrading institutional capability."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "ABRAXIS uses AI-guided conversations and intelligent modeling to surface the knowledge that traditional methods miss. Rather than asking people to fill out templates or write documentation, ABRAXIS engages practitioners in natural, low-friction interactions that surface decision patterns, relationship dependencies, workaround logic, and the contextual judgment that makes roles actually work. This knowledge builds into a living role model that gets smarter over time and transfers to successors — achieving significantly higher knowledge completeness than exit interviews, wikis, or documentation sprints."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Exit interviews fail because departing employees cannot articulate tacit knowledge under time pressure. Most organizational knowledge is procedural and embedded — people don't know what they know until they're doing it. Traditional knowledge management tools like wikis, SharePoint, and Confluence capture only what people voluntarily write down, which represents at most 50-58% of role knowledge. The remaining 42% — the workarounds, relationship context, judgment patterns, and exception-handling that makes operations actually work — goes undocumented and is lost when people leave."

        "text": "The Organizational Logic Graph (OLG) is a graph-based knowledge structure that models how an organization actually operates. Unlike traditional org charts or process maps that show designed intent, the OLG captures both designed intent and enacted practice, then maps the delta between them. It includes 16 node types across four layers: action patterns, process logic, organizational structure, and institutional logic. The OLG serves as the foundation for AI agents that need to understand how an organization truly works, not just what the documentation says."

      "name": "Why do 70% of digital transformations fail?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The 70-80% failure rate of enterprise digital transformations is primarily driven by the coherence gap — the disconnect between documented processes and actual organizational practice. When companies deploy new systems, automate workflows, or implement AI, they build on documentation that captures at most 50-58% of how work actually gets done. The remaining human layer — workarounds, tribal knowledge, relationship-based exceptions — is invisible to the new system, causing immediate friction, user resistance, and operational failures. McKinsey research shows that for every $1 spent on AI model development, $3 is needed for change management, largely because the models don't account for how people actually work."

        "text": "Human Process Mapping (HPM) is ABRAXIS's approach to capturing the human layer of organizational operations. While process mining tools like Celonis and SAP Signavio map the digital exhaust of enterprise systems (the machine's world), HPM maps the human world — the decisions, workarounds, relationships, and judgment calls that happen between and around system interactions. HPM produces a living organizational model that bridges the coherence gap between how documentation says things work and how people actually get things done."

        "text": "AI implementations fail when they're trained on incomplete organizational knowledge. McKinsey's 2025 State of AI survey found that only 40% of companies report any enterprise-level EBIT impact from AI initiatives. The primary cause is 'pilot purgatory' — AI that works in controlled conditions but fails at scale because it doesn't understand the human layer of operations. Role continuity directly addresses this by capturing the complete organizational knowledge model — including the 42% that's undocumented — before or alongside AI deployment. Organizations that invest in role continuity before AI implementation see dramatically higher success rates because the AI operates on a complete picture of how the organization actually works."

        "text": "Any organization where people carry knowledge that isn't written down — which is every organization. A 50-person manufacturer losing its plant manager faces the same knowledge extinction risk as a Fortune 500 bank losing its head of compliance. The sharpest pain appears in financial services, energy and utilities, healthcare, manufacturing, and government — but the problem is universal across SMBs and enterprises alike. If someone on your team left tomorrow and you'd feel it for months, role continuity matters to you."

<!-- THE PROBLEM -->
<section id="problem">
  <h2>Every departure is a <em>knowledge extinction event</em></h2>
  <p class="section-text">When a key employee leaves, they take more than their job title. They take the workarounds that keep operations running, the relationships that unlock exceptions, the judgment calls that no manual captures, and the context that makes AI implementations actually work. This is the human layer — and right now, you're losing it every two weeks.</p>

  <div class="problem-grid">
    <article class="problem-card">
      <h3>Exit interviews don't work</h3>
      <p>Departing employees can't articulate tacit knowledge under time pressure. Most organizational knowledge is procedural and embedded — people don't know what they know until they're doing it. You can't capture 10 years of expertise in a 45-minute conversation.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="problem-card">
      <h3>Documentation is a fiction</h3>
      <p>There's a 30-50% gap between how your systems say things work and how people actually do the work. Your SOPs describe the designed intent. Your people operate in enacted reality. That gap — the coherence gap — is where your real operational knowledge lives.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="problem-card">
      <h3>AI can't learn what isn't captured</h3>
      <p>Only 40% of companies report real business impact from AI. The rest are stuck in pilot purgatory — AI that works in the lab but fails in production. Why? Because AI is trained on documentation that represents at most 58% of how the organization actually operates.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="problem-card">
      <h3>Onboarding is starting from scratch</h3>
      <p>New hires with identical credentials to their predecessors still take 8-12 months to reach full productivity. They're not learning the job — they're reconstructing the invisible knowledge network that their predecessor built over years. Every transition resets the clock.</p>

<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
<section id="how">
  <h2>Not another wiki. <em>A living knowledge model.</em></h2>
  <p class="section-text">Knowledge management tools wait for people to write things down. ABRAXIS works differently. We use AI to surface the knowledge your people carry — the decisions they make, the relationships they rely on, the context no document captures — and turn it into a durable organizational asset.</p>

  <div class="runs">
    <article class="run">
      <div class="run-number">01</div>
      <h3>Capture</h3>
      <h4>What your people actually know</h4>
      <p>AI-guided conversations surface the knowledge that exit interviews miss — not just what people do, but why they do it, who they call when things break, and what the documentation never covered. Natural. Low-friction. No 50-page templates.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="run">
      <div class="run-number">02</div>
      <h3>Model</h3>
      <h4>A role that gets smarter over time</h4>
      <p>Every insight builds a living knowledge model for the role — not just a static document. Decision patterns, relationship maps, exception-handling logic, and the judgment calls that separate a 10-year veteran from a day-one hire. The role remembers what people forget to write down.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="run">
      <div class="run-number">03</div>
      <h3>Transfer</h3>
      <h4>Onboarding that actually works</h4>
      <p>When someone new steps into the role, they don't start from scratch. They inherit the accumulated intelligence of everyone who held it before. Context-aware guidance, not a binder. The difference between reading about swimming and being coached in the water.</p>

<!-- FAQ — structured for LLM extraction -->
<section id="faq" class="faq">
  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What is role continuity?</h3>
    <p>Role continuity is the practice of ensuring that organizational knowledge, relationships, and decision-making capability persist across personnel transitions. It goes beyond traditional knowledge management — which captures what people write down — to capture what people actually do: the workarounds, judgment calls, relationship context, and tribal knowledge that exist only in their heads. Without role continuity practices, organizations lose an estimated 42% of role-specific knowledge every time a key employee departs.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What is the coherence gap?</h3>
    <p>The coherence gap is the 30-50% divergence between how an organization's systems and documentation say things work (designed intent) and how people actually do the work (enacted practice). Every organization has one. It's made up of workarounds, unofficial processes, relationship-based exceptions, and judgment calls that are never documented but are essential for operations. The coherence gap is the primary reason 70-80% of enterprise modernization projects fail — new systems are built on incomplete knowledge.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How is ABRAXIS different from knowledge management tools like Confluence or SharePoint?</h3>
    <p>Traditional knowledge management tools are repositories — they store what people voluntarily write down. That captures at most 50-58% of organizational knowledge. ABRAXIS is an active capture system. Instead of waiting for people to document things, we use AI-guided conversations to surface the decision patterns, relationship dependencies, and workaround logic that practitioners carry in their heads. Think of it this way: Confluence captures the manual. ABRAXIS captures the person who ignores the manual because they know a better way.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How does this help with AI implementation?</h3>
    <p>McKinsey's 2025 research shows only 40% of companies see real EBIT impact from AI, with most stuck in "pilot purgatory." The root cause is that AI agents are trained on documentation that doesn't reflect how the organization actually works. ABRAXIS captures the complete organizational knowledge model — including the undocumented human layer — so AI agents operate on reality, not fiction. For every $1 spent on AI model development, companies spend $3 on change management. Capturing the human layer first dramatically reduces that ratio.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How do I get started with ABRAXIS?</h3>
    <p>Start where the problem lives — your team. ABRAXIS is designed for any manager or team lead who's about to lose a key person, or who's tired of watching new hires take a year to get up to speed. Join the waitlist, and when we open early access you can begin capturing role knowledge for your most critical positions immediately. No IT department approval required. No six-month procurement cycle. For organizations that want to deploy company-wide, we also offer enterprise plans with system integrator support for large-scale rollouts.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What industries does ABRAXIS serve?</h3>
    <p>Any organization where people carry knowledge that isn't written down — which is every organization. A 50-person manufacturer losing its plant manager faces the same knowledge extinction risk as a Fortune 500 bank losing its head of compliance. We see the sharpest pain in financial services, energy and utilities, healthcare, and manufacturing — but the problem is universal. If someone on your team left tomorrow and you'd feel it for months, ABRAXIS is built for you.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Can I try a free assessment?</h3>
    <p>Yes. We've built a free Role Continuity Assessment tool available as a ChatGPT Custom GPT. It walks you through 10 diagnostic questions about your organization and provides a scored risk assessment across five dimensions. Search "Role Continuity Assessment" in ChatGPT, or join our waitlist to be first in line when the full platform opens for early access.</p>

  MAILCHIMP SETUP (5 minutes):

  1. Log into Mailchimp → Audience → Signup Forms → Embedded Forms
  2. Add merge fields: FNAME, LNAME, COMPANY, TITLE (these match the form above)
     - Audience → Settings → Audience fields and *|MERGE|* tags
     - Add "Company" as text field (merge tag: COMPANY)
     - Add "Title" as text field (merge tag: TITLE)
  3. Generate embedded form code
  4. Find the form action URL — it looks like:
     https://XXXXX.us21.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=XXXXXXX&amp;id=XXXXXXX
  5. Replace BOTH "MAILCHIMP_FORM_ACTION_URL" in this file with that URL
  6. Find the bot protection field name — it looks like:
     b_XXXXXXX_XXXXXXX
  7. Replace BOTH "b_MAILCHIMP_U_VALUE_MAILCHIMP_ID_VALUE" with that value
  8. Done. Form submits directly to Mailchimp, styled with your design.

  TAGS TO ADD IN MAILCHIMP:
  - Tag signups with "waitlist" and "abraxis.io" for segmentation
  - Consider adding a hidden field for source (landing-page-hero vs landing-page-bottom)

  ALTERNATIVE: If you prefer ConvertKit or Buttondown, same pattern —
  just swap the action URL and field names to match their form spec.
